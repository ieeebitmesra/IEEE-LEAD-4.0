This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

Visit the website at ['News-Lead'](https://news-lead.vercel.app/)

As required by the mandatory milestones, the website showcases the top headlines, according to user selection of category or country.

The website is also made to be responsive and accessible.

Since NextJS is used, server side components are rendered quickly, and no additional re-renders of client components occur.
